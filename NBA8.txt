The NBA will commemorate celebrating its 75th anniversary season with a list of its greatest players, the league just announced.

Like the league did in its 50th anniversary in 1997 when it announced its 50 greatest players in the 1996-97 season, it will do the same this time around.

A panel of media, current and former players, coaches, general managers, and team executives will select the team, which will be unveiled before the start of the season. The NBA has also released its NBA 75 logo in recent weeks and will have several celebrations and partner activities throughout the season.
